    <h2>New Vocabulary</h2>

    <p>
      A <b>variable</b> is a general name for a values that changes. An
      <b>independent variable </b>
      is one that an experimenter can control. For example, the CO2 levels in
      this simulation is an independent variable.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <b>dependent variable</b> is an outcome of the experiment such as the
      final global temperature at the end of the simulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Independent variables can also be called <b>parameters</b> or
      <b>attributes</b>. Each column in the data table below shows the values
      for variables such as time, distance, mass, or period. Columns can contain
      attributes that are set by the model or by your experiment, or that are
      the result of a measurement or calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each row in the table shows a <b>run</b>, which is the result of one
      experiment. Most runs consist of many samples collected over time. This is
      called a <b>time-series</b>. Each row also has the <b>summary</b> values
      for the run, such as temperature, CO2 levels, or years.

    <p>
      Note that there are two “levels” in the table: <b>time series</b> of a
      single run (on the left), and the <b>summary attributes</b> of different
      runs (on the right).
