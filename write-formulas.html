    <h2>How do I write formulas?</h2>

    When you create a new attribute, you can just give it a name and add values
    to the column you’ve created, leaving the “formula” box blank. Or you can
    write a formula:<br /><br />

    <ul>
      <li>
        Use may use standard algebraic operation symbols: +, -, *, / and
        parentheses ( ).
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the drop-down list of functions for other operations like exponents.
        There are quite a few other functions as well, such as ways to refer to
        previous and next values in the table.
      </li>
      <li>
        To insert other attribute values, select their names from the Insert
        Value menu. Do NOT type in the name of the attribute.
      </li>
    </ul>
