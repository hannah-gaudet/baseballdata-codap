    <h3>Getting Started</h3>

    <p>
      This workspace contains tables containing baseball statistics from 2019.
      All player specific information is in the player_id_mapping table. All
      other tables only have a playerid to identify who the rows correspond to -
      <b>how could we figure out which name belongs to each row?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Your task is to answer some of the following questions:</b>
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>What was Bryce Harper's batting average in 2019?</li>
      <li>Which Phillies player walked the most often in 2019?</li>
    </ol>
