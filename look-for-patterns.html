    <h2>How can I look for patterns?</h2>

    Graphs are wonderful for noticing patterns – much better than a list of
    numbers!
    <ul>
      <li>
        When you want to compare two variables, make a new graph with one
        variable on each axis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Focus on the shape of the graph first. How would you describe the
        relationship in words? Are there any points that seem out of place?
      </li>
      <li>Do more runs to fill in gaps and add extreme values.</li>
      <li>
        See if the results are variable or erratic by comparing two identical
        runs.
      </li>
      <li>Connect points using the ruler menu.</li>
      <li>
        Compare the shape to a movable line using the ruler menu.
