    <h2>New Vocabulary</h2>

    <p>
      A <b>variable</b> is a general name for a values that changes. In baseball,
      statistics like batting average, strikeout rate, and age are variables. We
      usually use abbreviations to refer to each of these - writing out the same
      words over and over can get tiring!

      Independent variables can also be called <b>parameters</b> or
      <b>attributes</b>. Each column in the data table below shows the values
      for variables such as time, distance, mass, or period. Columns can contain
      attributes that are set by the model or by your experiment, or that are
      the result of a measurement or calculation.

      Note that there are two “levels” in the table: <b>time series</b> of a
      single run (on the left), and the <b>summary attributes</b> of different
      runs (on the right).
