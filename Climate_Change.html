    <h3>Getting Started</h3>

    <p>
      This is a simulation model of Climate Changes. When you start the model,
      it runs for 70 years and then stops. You can run the model in "slow
      motion" to see what's going on, or "fast" to quickly collect data.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b
        >Your task is to discover how one of the many variables that affect
        Earthâ€™s climate could change the global temperature 70 years from today
        (Year 2084). See how a change in the Earth's Climate variable that you
        chose affects the global atmospheric temperature.</b

    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (CO2 molecules)</li>
      <li>Sun's brightness (the number of yellow sunrays)</li>
      <li>
        Albedo which is the reflectivity of Earth's surface (color of the
        horizontal surface)
      </li>
      <li>Number of clouds in the atmosphere</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The small graph will show two temperature lines: one for yearly
      temperature and the other for 10 year average temperature. In the model
      you will also see heat packets representing heat energy in the earth and
      heat radiation given off by the earth's surface.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alter the variables to see how they will affect the 10 year average
      temperature. Click the "Analyze Data" button and as you alter a variable
      watch how it populates in the table.<img

      />
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you have altered each of the variables, plot some new variables into
      a graph
      <img class="icon" src="../../../../Common/images/graph_icon.png" /> and
      see what you notice. Drag two variables from the table into your graph.
      You can drag a third variable into the middle of the graph to create a
      legend. What did you discover?
