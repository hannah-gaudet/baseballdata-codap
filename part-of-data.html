    <h2>How can I look at only part of my data?</h2>
    <p>
      By default, all the data shows up on a graph. Often you want to look at
      one run or a set of runs for which only one variable is changing. There
      are several ways to do this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Select the runs from the table by highlighting the rows (click and
        drag). Those rows that are highlighted in the table will also be
        highlighted in the graph. <br />
      </li>
      <li>Drag across the graph points you want highlighted.</li>
      <li>
        Choose a single run from the row of numbers at the top of the graph.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the <b>Hide and Show</b> function in the eye menu on the graph.

      </li>
      <li>
        Color the datasets by attribute. Drag an attribute into the center of
        the graph (making a legend) and choose <b>Treat as categorical</b>.
